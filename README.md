# ownCloud Documentation

<!-- OSPO-managed README | Generated: 2026-08-21 | v2 -->

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-AGPL--3.0-blue.svg)](LICENSE) [![ownCloud OSPO](https://img.shields.io/badge/OSPO-ownCloud-blue)](https://kiteworks.com/opensource)

Consolidated, single-repository prototype of the ownCloud documentation. It
replaces the previous 9-repo setup (1 orchestrator + 7 content repos + a custom
UI repo) with **one monorepo** built by Antora.

Live (GitHub Pages): https://doc.owncloud.com

## What changed vs. the legacy setup

| Area | Legacy | Here |
|------|--------|------|
| Repos | 9 | 1 (this repo) |
| Versions | git branches + backporting | **folders** under `content/<product>/<version>/` |
| Branch model | `master` + N version branches per repo | `main` only |
| Search | Elasticsearch + custom index extension + CI secrets | **Pagefind** (static, build-time) |
| UI | custom Gulp/Browserify/jQuery `docs-ui` + `ui-bundle.zip` | **stock Antora default UI** + `ui/supplemental/` |
| Content sources | 7 remote GitHub repos × branches | local folders, authored here (upstream mirror retired) |
| Global attributes | fetched from GitHub at build | local `global-attributes.yml` |

Antora + AsciiDoc are kept (native multi-version/multi-component support).

## Layout

```
site.yml                 Antora playbook (local content only)
package.json             antora + asciidoctor + pagefind toolchain
antora-extensions/       comp-version, latest/next-alias, sitemap-cleanup, global-attributes loader
asciidoc-extensions/     tabs, remote-include
extension-tests/         node --test suite (`npm test`); build first, several tests skip without public/
global-attributes.yml    site-wide AsciiDoc attributes (local)
ui/supplemental/         branding + Pagefind modal search on the stock UI
ui/supplemental/js/vendor/ gitignored; synced from node_modules by scripts/sync-vendor-assets.js
content/<product>/<ver>/ each version is a folder with its own antora.yml
sync/                    retired upstream-mirror tooling, kept as provenance
scripts/                 build-time helpers (npm `pre*` hooks), e.g. sync-vendor-assets.js
.github/workflows/ci.yml build → pagefind → deploy to GitHub Pages
```

## Versioning model

### One folder per version

Each product version is a folder `content/<product>/<version>/` carrying its own
`antora.yml`, whose `version:` key repeats the folder name
(`content/ocis/8.2/antora.yml` → `version: '8.2'`). `site.yml` aggregates them by
glob (`content/ocis/*`, `content/server/*`, …), so **the published version set is
exactly the folder set on disk** — adding or removing a version needs no playbook
edit.

Two components are versionless and have no version folder: `content/main` (the
`ROOT` landing component, `version: ~`) and `content/webui` (a single rolling
component).

### Only explicit version numbers as folder names

Folder names are pure version numbers — `8.2`, `10.16`, `12.7`. There is
deliberately **no `master`, `next`, `dev`, or `latest` folder**, and none should
be added:

- **A moving path segment is a broken promise.** `…/ocis/next/` points at a
  different release every few months, so links, bookmarks, and indexed search
  results silently retarget to content the reader was never sent to.
  `…/ocis/8.3/` means one release forever.
- **Release rollover moves no URLs.** The in-development line already lives at
  its real number, marked `prerelease: true` with a `display_version: '8.3 (dev)'`
  (see `content/ocis/8.3/antora.yml`). Shipping it means dropping those two keys —
  no path changes, no redirects. With a `next` folder, every page of the release
  would change its URL on ship day.
- **The version is legible everywhere it matters** — folder, path, PR diff, and
  URL. A reviewer reads `content/ocis/8.2/…` in a diff and knows the target
  version without consulting a branch→version mapping.
- **`latest` and `next` are generated, never source folders.**
  `antora-extensions/latest-alias.js` publishes `/<product>/latest/` as a tree of
  redirect stubs pointing at the newest non-prerelease version; `site.yml`
  deliberately does not set `latest_version_segment`.
  `antora-extensions/next-alias.js` does the same for `/<product>/next/`, the
  version segment the legacy site used for each product's `master` build — those
  URLs are still linked and indexed, so they redirect to the closest live page
  instead of 404ing. Its target is the component's prerelease version, falling
  back to the latest release (and, per page, to the latest release for anything
  the dev line dropped). Both trees are `noindex` and stay out of the sitemap.

See the dev-version note under [Versions imported](#versions-imported) for what
moves together on release rollover.

### Backporting

There are no branches, so there is nothing to cherry-pick. Backporting means
**making the same edit in every version folder that should carry it**:

```
content/ocis/8.3/modules/.../page.adoc   original edit
content/ocis/8.2/modules/.../page.adoc   same edit
content/ocis/8.1/modules/.../page.adoc   same edit
```

One PR then carries the change for every affected version: the reviewer sees the
whole backport at once, and no version is deferred to a follow-up that never
happens. The cost is N copies of the hunk instead of one commit replayed N times;
in exchange there is no conflict resolution, which matters because these docs
genuinely diverge per version (paths, attribute values, screenshots). Text that
is truly version-independent belongs in a shared partial or a
`global-attributes.yml` attribute rather than in N copies.

> ℹ️ **`modules/` is authored here.** The upstream mirror is retired — the
> legacy `owncloud/docs-*` repos no longer feed this repo, so every file under
> `content/<product>/<version>/` including `modules/` is edited directly in this
> repo and a PR against `main` is the only way content changes land. Nothing
> overwrites your edits; the backport rule above is the whole mechanism.
>
> `sync/` is kept as a historical record of which upstream repo and branch each
> folder was imported from. `sync/sync-repo.sh` mirror-*replaces* `modules/` and
> would discard local edits, so it refuses to run — see `sync/manifest.yml`.

### Dropping a version

Delete the folder:

```sh
rm -r content/server/VERSION
```

That is the whole content change — `site.yml` needs no edit, because it globs.
Four bits of bookkeeping remain:

1. Update the hand-maintained `latest-*` / `previous-*` / `current-*` attributes
   in `global-attributes.yml` if the removed version appeared in them. The
   `latest` and `next` aliases themselves move automatically (`latest-alias.js`
   derives its target from the newest non-prerelease version, `next-alias.js` from
   the `prerelease` flag).
2. **Server only:** drop the segment from `PUBLISHED_VERSIONS` in
   `ui/supplemental/js/go-redirect.js` **and** from the version loop in
   `extension-tests/go-redirect.test.js` — two independent hand-maintained lists,
   and the suite fails on either one alone. It also fails if `PUBLISHED_VERSIONS`
   drifts from the published `public/server/*` trees. Only real version numbers
   are maintained there — `latest` and `next` are permanent entries, because they
   are generated redirect trees rather than versions. Legacy `go.php?to=` links
   for the removed version then fall back to `latest`, which is the intended
   safety net.
3. Drop the version's row from `sync/manifest.yml` and from the table below. Both
   record which upstream branch each folder came from, so a row for a folder that
   no longer exists is misleading rather than historical.
4. Accept that the version's URLs now 404 — nothing redirects a retired version
   tree. Drop a version only when its inbound links are acceptable casualties, or
   add redirects deliberately.

## Versions imported

| Product | Versions (folder) | Notes |
|---------|-------------------|-------|
| main | — | ROOT landing component (versionless) |
| server | 11.0, 10.16 | no 11.0 branch upstream yet; master is the 11.0 line and is `latest` |
| ocis | 8.3 (dev), 8.2, 8.1, 8.0, 7.3 | master→8.3 (prerelease); 8.2 branch is `latest` |
| webui | — | single rolling component (versionless) |
| desktop | 7.2 (dev), 7.1, 6.0, 5.3 | master→7.2 (prerelease); 7.1 branch is `latest` |
| ios | 12.7, 12.6 | 12.7 branch is `latest` (released 2026-05-19) |
| android | 4.8 (dev), 4.7 | 4.8 branch imported as prerelease; 4.7 branch is `latest` |

> ⚠️ **Dev version numbers are provisional.** The in-development folders
> (`ocis/8.3`, `desktop/7.2`, `android/4.8`, …) are marked `prerelease: true` and
> carry a `(dev)` `display_version`. They were the upcoming numbers chosen at
> import time — rename the folder + drop `prerelease` on actual release.
>
> On release rollover, three things move together: drop `prerelease` +
> `display_version` from the released folder's `antora.yml`, bump the
> `latest-*`/`previous-*` attributes in `global-attributes.yml`, and bump the
> version segments of the affected links in `ui/supplemental/llms.txt` (those URLs
> are pinned deliberately, because `/latest/` is a `noindex` redirect stub).
> `extension-tests/static-files.test.js` cross-checks the `latest-*-version`
> attributes against the content tree and `llms.txt`, and fails the build while
> those three disagree. It checks **only** `latest-*-version`: nothing in the suite
> verifies `previous-*-version`, `current-server-version` or
> `latest-server-download-version`, so a stale one of those renders site-wide with
> a green build. (`previous-android-version` equalling `latest-android-version`
> today suggests this has already happened once.)
>
> Dropping `prerelease` also moves `/<product>/next/` on to the newly opened dev
> line by itself — `next-alias.js` reads the flag, so there is nothing to bump.
>
> Then open the next dev line by copying the released folder to its new number and
> re-adding the two keys. **Server only:** that copy publishes a new
> `public/server/<version>/` tree, so add the segment to `PUBLISHED_VERSIONS` in
> `ui/supplemental/js/go-redirect.js` in the same commit —
> `extension-tests/go-redirect.test.js` fails while that list and the published
> trees disagree, in either direction (the mirror of step 2 under
> [Dropping a version](#dropping-a-version)). Add it to the version loop in that
> test file as well: unlike a removal, an *addition* the loop does not cover fails
> nothing, so the new segment would silently never be exercised.
>
> The branch references in the Notes column above are **historical**: they record
> which upstream `owncloud/docs-*` branch each folder was last imported from
> before the mirror was retired. They are no longer live mappings.

## Build locally

```sh
npm ci
npm run antora     # build to public/
npm run pagefind   # inject static search index into public/pagefind/
npm run serve      # http-server on :8080
```

Node 22 is recommended (matches CI).

### License Migration to Apache 2.0

The OSPO is driving a strategic relicensing of ownCloud repositories toward the
[Apache License 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0), following
the [Apache Software Foundation's third-party license policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html).

Individual repositories will migrate as their audit is completed. The LICENSE file
in each repo reflects its **current** license status (not the target).

**Current license: AGPL-3.0** (Category X per Apache policy -- cannot be included in Apache-2.0 works).

Migration prerequisites for this repository:

- **CLA/DCO coverage**: All past contributors must have signed agreements permitting relicensing
- **Copyleft dependency audit**: All AGPL/GPL dependencies must be replaced or isolated
- **KDE heritage review**: Any code with KDE-era copyrights requires legal analysis
- **Complete relicensing**: AGPL-3.0 is a strong copyleft license; migration requires full relicensing of all files, not just a header change
